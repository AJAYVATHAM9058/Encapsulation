# Encapsulation
--> Encapsulation in Java is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP)

--> Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.

--> It is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield. 

--> Encapsulation can be achieved by Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.
